PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project is basically a crude clone of AirBnB; it involves building a minishell that can operate in interactive and non-interactive modes.

COMMAND INTERPRETER DESCRIPTION:

Utilizing a robust storage system is the first step. We will be able to abstract between "My Object" and "How they are saved and persisted" thanks to this storage engine. This implies that you won't have to pay attention to (take care of) how your objects are saved from your console code (the command interpreter itself) or from the front-end and RestAPI you will write later.

HOW TO START IT:

In order to start the console, you must use the following command: ./console.py

HOW ITS USED:

manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interprete

store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit

EXAMPLE:

$ ./console.py

(hbnb) help



Documented commands (type help <topic>):

========================================

EOF  help  quit



(hbnb) 

(hbnb) 

(hbnb) quit
